# Artificial-Neural-Network
Simple model of the artificial Neural Network as described on 
the http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/MultiLayerNeuralNetworks/ 
webpage. 

By default, the program takes training data and the corresponding labels from the 
training_set.dat and labels.dat files, respectively. Feature vectors 
should be written in lines. Each vector on a separate line (see example). 
Each label on the corresponding to the feature vector line in the 
labels.dat file. 

To run the program, just run main.py file and follow instructions. 
You can choose the topology and parameters of the neural network 
and/or default files for the training data and labels.
